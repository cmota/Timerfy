# Timerfy

![Workflow result](https://github.com/cmota/Timerfy/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
A simple, yet beautiful timer done with Jetpack Compose.

A special thank you to [@henrikemacedo](https://twitter.com/henrikemacedo) who designed this beautiful UI.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Although the UI is entirely done with Jetpack Compose I've focused on doing most of it using canvas in order to make a number have two different colors depending on the current progress of the timer.

I want to revisit this project later on to play a bit more with the animations.
